# PhytoProm

Phytoprom is an enrichment analysis tool for candidate cis-regulatory elements (CCREs). It is based on plant gene promoters available on Phytozome database. Phytoprom is a user-friendly web application, providing a way to characterize large-scale gene promoter datasets. The tool also makes it possible to download sets of species-specific promoters, transcripts and proteins under study for analysis in other databases.
